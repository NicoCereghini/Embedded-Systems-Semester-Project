# Embedded-Systems-Semester-Project
A repo to show off my code and the latest progress of my SER 456 Embedded Systems project

Inside the folder, you will see many files. The only code I personally wrote is contained in cereghini_firmware.c file. To see a detailed and easy to read version of my circuit schematic, see the cereghini_assignment6_cricuit.pdf.

To see a Demo of the latest progress I achieved, follow this link: https://youtu.be/2U3yhBmDay8
