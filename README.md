# Embedded-Systems-Semester-Project
A repo to show off my code and the latest progress of my SER 456 Embedded Systems project

# Overview
This project was designed entirely by me (Nico Cereghini), at the start of my embedded systems class in Fall 2022. Originally, I wanted to design a robot that moves with a push from the user, almost as if the robot has momentum. This would use an accelerometer to detect the user's push, and motors for actuation. I designed a chassis out of LEGOs to hold the circuit. When I started exploring the parts needed and the programming involved, I ended up falling short of my requirements yet had figured out the working motors. What took the most time for me ended up being the accelerometer. To still have some fun with the project, I added UART functionality to still give the user some element of control.

Inside the folder, you will see many files. The only code I personally wrote is contained in cereghini_firmware.c file. To see a detailed and easy to read version of my circuit schematic, see the cereghini_assignment6_cricuit.pdf.
